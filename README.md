Load the .CSV file and Check the file

Using Mapping the phase of code

And import libray and assign the model creation

Then, Input and Output slipt

Then catogarical data convert the numerical data

And the additional inputs drop the cloumns and check this correct dataset in input data

And, Training and Test set Split

After model creation of import sklearn and using of evaluation of metrics

Use to R2 Square formula and actual to predict value pass the formula and predict

0 to 1 using it near 1 is a good predict ex(0.90,0.99)

Then,check the model verify and save the model

Create a support vector machince liabray import the sklearn and  fine calculate the mean and standard diviation called to a tranform using better calculation   

Go to the deployment and create a new file and load the model and used to keywords of file

And predict the proft in single file data.

And open the file use the input and predict the user want to output to predict
